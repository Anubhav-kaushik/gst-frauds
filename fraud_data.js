            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">In a prominent case, a real estate developer in Bengaluru was investigated for systematically underreporting the value of properties sold. The modus operandi involved a dual pricing structure: a higher amount was collected from the homebuyer, often involving a cash component, while a significantly lower value was declared in the official sale agreement. This practice of under-invoicing allowed the builder to substantially reduce the applicable GST liability, causing a significant loss to the public exchequer.</p>

Such cases highlight the potential for evasion by operating in regulatory grey areas while facilitating a high volume of taxable sales, necessitating clearer rules for aggregators.`,
